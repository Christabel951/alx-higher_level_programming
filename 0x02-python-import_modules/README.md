**Python - Import & Modules**

This project covers concepts that dig into: how to import functions from another file, how to use imported functions, how to create a module, how to use the built-in function dir(), how to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported and how to use command line arguments with Python programs.

#h4 Programs created majorly cover functionalities involving:

* Importation of the function def add(a, b): from the file add\_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
* Importation of functions from the file calculator\_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
* Printing the __number of__ and the __list of__ its arguments.
* Printing the result of the addition of all arguments.
* Printing of all the names defined by the compiled module hidden\_4.pyc (please download it locally).
* Importation of the variable a from the file variable\_load\_5.py and prints its value.
