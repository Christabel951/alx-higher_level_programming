# Python - Inheritance

## Concepts

* Superclass / baseclass / parentclass, subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When an instance can have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* Default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Attributes or methods available by heritage to subclasses
* The purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use __isinstance__, __issubclass__, __type__ and __super__ **built-in** functions

###Programs Include:
* **0-lookup.py** - a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.
* 1-my\_list.py, tests/1-my\_list.txt - a class MyList that inherits from list
* 2-is\_same\_class.py - a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.
* 3-is\_kind\_of\_class.py - a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.
* 4-inherits\_from.py - a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.
* 5-base\_geometry.py -  an empty class BaseGeometry.
* 6-base\_geometry.py - a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base\_geometry.py).
* 7-base\_geometry.py, tests/7-base\_geometry.txt - a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base\_geometry.py).
* 8-rectangle.py - a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base\_geometry.py).
* 9-rectangle.py - a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base\_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py
* 10-square.py -  a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)
* 11-square.py - a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).
