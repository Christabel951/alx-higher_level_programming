**Python - Classes and Objects**

Programs include:
* An empty class _Square_ that defines a square
* A class _Square_ that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)
	* Private instance attribute: size
	* Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
	* You are not allowed to import any module
* A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)
	* Private instance attribute: size
	* Instantiation with optional size: def \_\_init\_\_(self, size=0):
	* size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
	* If size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	* You are not allowed to import any module
* A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)
	* Private instance attribute: size
	* Instantiation with optional size: def \_\_init\_\_(self, size=0):
	* size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
	* If size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	* Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
	* You are not allowed to import any module
* A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)
	* Private instance attribute: size:
		* property def size(self): to retrieve it
		* property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
	* size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
	* if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	* Instantiation with optional size: def \_\_init\_\_(self, size=0):
	* Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
	* You are not allowed to import any module

	* Private instance attribute: size:
		* property def size(self): to retrieve it
		* property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
	* size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
	* if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	* Instantiation with optional size: def \_\_init\_\_(self, size=0):
	* Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
	* Public instance method: def my\_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
	* if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
	* You are not allowed to import any module
