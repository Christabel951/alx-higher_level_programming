**Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary**

The project explores sets, dictionaries;lambda, map, reduce and filter functions. How to use them, how to iterate through the data structures and working with the functions to perform various sets and dictionaries operations.

* A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
* function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
* A function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer
* A function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
* A function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
* A function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
* A function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
* A function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
* A function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
* A function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
* A function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
