* 5-save\_to\_json\_file.py -  a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation
* 6-load\_from\_json\_file.py - a function that creates an Object from a JSON file
* 7-add\_item.py -  a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file
* 8-class\_to\_json.py -  a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object
* 9-student.py - a class Student
* 10-student.py - a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)
